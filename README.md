# UFCaller

UFCaller is a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to select their desired UFC fight from the scheduled cards. The app will notify users with an alarm or call when their selected fight is about to start, eliminating the need to constantly monitor the screen for hours.

## Features

- Browse and select fights from upcoming UFC cards
- Receive notifications (alarm or call) when your selected fight is about to start
- Seamless integration with the backend server for up-to-date fight information
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and fight selection

## Development Stage

The Flutter and .NET portions of the UFCaller app are currently under active development. This repository contains the Flutter codebase for the Android version of the app. The iOS version will be developed separately using SwiftUI at a later date, and the backend is being built with .NET. Currently, the development efforts are focused on the Flutter and .NET components.
